MVC Decorator Pattern in .net core with dependency injection and caching

Contains:
•	MVC
•	WebAPI
•	Caching
•	Dependency Injection
•	And of course, Decorator Pattern! 
•	Adapter pattern - Design criteria for Decorator pattern is that you should have common base class (example - base interface), if you have a class which you do not own then you can create an intermediate class and implement your base class, this essentially is adapter pattern
Decorator pattern is Go4 deign pattern, it is type of structural design pattern.
Adding behavior to the class without making changes to that class. E.g. weather class, and then add logging to that class. This can be achieved using decorator class. Basically, decorator allows to extend the class and honor Open-Closed principle.
